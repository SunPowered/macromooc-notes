Long Run Economic Growth
========================

Going to look at key characteristics of economies in long run growth and why is it
that different countries have different experiences with long run economic growth.
A very big area in macroeconomics, one of the oldest disciplines.

There have been many exciting recent developments, they build on the concepts covered in
this course.  

GDP per Capita
===============

For the US, per capita GDP has risen dramatically. There is an exponential growth.
It is not smooth, there was the Great Depression in the 30's, other business cycles 
are evident as well. (Source of graph?)

### The Nature of Exponential Growth ###

Exponential curves have the following forms:

$$G_{t} = G_{0}{(1 + \alpha )}^{t}$$

where $\alpha$ is the growth rate for the economy under question.  This results in the following:

$$\ln{G_{t}} = \ln{G_{0]}} + t * \ln{1+\alpha}$$

if $\alpha$ is small ($\alpha << 1$), then $\ln{(1+\alpha)} = \alpha$,

Now we can get a nice relationship for the year on year change:

$$\ln{G_{t}/G_{t-1}}=\alpha$$

We call $\alpha$ the growth rate.  When the US GDP per capita is plotted against a log
scale, there is a clear trend upwards.  

Intersting to note that there could be long term periodic fluctuations in an modern industrialized
economy that we are only able to recently measure.  


Fundamental Sources of Economic Growth
---------------------------------------

The real GDP per capita is the total flow of income  / population

*   Notation: $N$ is the total labour force produced in the economy.

It is interesting to break up the income / population into

$$\frac{G}{P} = \frac{G}{N} * \frac{N}{P}$$

The first term is defined as the average productivity,  and is an important economic
factor, the second term is the proportion of population actively in the labour force,
and is more of a demographic factor. Both are important but the first will be 
focused on more than the second in these notes.

The Production Function
------------------------

### Basic Concepts ###

How do firms bring together factors of production to produce output.

A firm is an organization that exists to bring together the factors of production and 
together, produce output.  Here, more simple production functions will be studied.

Very simple PF consists of two levels or production, labour and capital.

Capital is used sometimes differently.  Here, it is the physical tangible equipment, buildings
tools and raw materials. These are often nown as the _primary_ factors of production.

They are not the only factors that firms use to produce output.  They are called secondary production,
examples are technology, skills, and everything that is not a primary factor of production.

### Production Table ###

A way of representing this idea of a production function.  It is an experiment to vary the amounts
of labour and capital while holding secondary factors unchanged and record the level of output 
that can be produced.  Labour is denoted as $L$ and capital $K$.

Capital/Labour  1       2       3       4
-------------  -------  ------  ------  -----------
1               2.00    2.83    3.46    4.00
2               2.83    4.00    4.90    5.66
3               3.46    4.90    6.00    6.93
4               4.00    5.66    6.93    8.00
5               4.47    6.32    7.75    8.94
6               4.90    6.93    8.49    9.80


If we look at the labour columns, we see what is known as diminishing marginal productivity of capital, ie
it costs more and more caital to achieve the same gains as previously attained. This is often called the
_marginal product of capital_, denoted by $MPK$.  The change in GDP from a change in capital. Another characteristic of 
production is a diminishing marginal productivity of labour.

A third characteristic of the production function is a constant relationship in the product of 
labour and capital.

$$L * K = const$$

This is known as _constant returns to scale_ of production, denoted by $CRP$.  Thus if we scale the amount of labour and
capital by the same factor, we get the same scaling in production.  This scaling is denoted with $\lambda$.

The production function is also denoted by a summarizing equation

$$y= A f(k,l)$$

where $y$ is the production output, $k$ is capital, and $l$ is labour. The variable $A$ are the
secondary factors of production.

By taking slices of the 3D surface represented by $y$, one can hold one variable fixed and plot the relationship of $y$ versus
the other variables.  The production function can also be scaled to the aggregate of production per person in an economy.
This representation is a plot of the GDP/person $y/l$ and the capital labour ratio $k/l$.  Note this assumes that everybody
in the economy is a member of the workforce.  This also has similar characteristics, with a DRS relationship, the rate of the 
DRS is a measure of $A$.

The important fact to remember is that for different levels of $k/l$, the strategy to maximize production output can
change.  Usually for a lower $k/l$, as in new economies, it is more effective to increase $k/l$ versus trying to raise
total factors of production, $A$.  As the diminishing returns applies, there is a point at which a marginal gain
in $A$ will produce a larger gain in $y$ versus a comparable marginal gain in $k/l$.  This hints that more developed
economies would be better served focusing on improving the secondary factors of production versus the primary, 
i.e. technology, specialised skills than reallocating more capital to labour.
