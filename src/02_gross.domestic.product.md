Gross Domestic Product
======================

An important metric economists use to quantify the size of an economy.  Many aspects of the macro
economy can be described using GDP

# Definition #

	Measures the flow of economic activity in a geographic region (usually a country) 
	over a particular period of time

Flow: A quantity which is changing, transient. Ex: income earned each week. 
	
Stock: a variable defined at a particular point in time. Ex: savings in a bank account

*	Flows build up stock.

# What is Economic Activity? #

Not a simple question, there are 3 distinct way to think about economic activity.

1.	Production		The flow of goods and services produced in and economy over a time period
2.	Expenditure		The flow of spending undertaken in the economy over a given time period
3.	Income			The flow of income earned in an economy over a time period


Amazingly, all 3 forms turn out to be identical.  Measuring economic activity from any of the 3 
forms results in an identical result.

# Flow of Production #

Taking a simple 2 stage production.  2 firms.  Firm 1 produces an intermediate good.  

The factors of production for Firm 1 is labour and capital.

	Labour: 	The workers producing the good
	Capital:	All money needed to keep production running

Firm 2 has its own factors of production; labour, capital, and intermediate good 1.
Firm 2 produces a final good.

If all flows were measured at all stages, there will be a double counting problem with
any intermediate goods. The price of the final good already reflects the cost of the 
intermediate good.  

Ex: Production of loaf of bread

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Stage of 				Value of	   Value of 		  Value Added
 Production				 Sales 		Int Goods ($)		  at the Stage  
--------------       ------------  ---------------     -----------------

      wheat				1.80			0					1.80
	  flour				3.00			1.80				1.20
	  dough				4.00			3.00				1.00
	 bread				4.40			4.00				0.40
														________
												Total		4.40				
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GDP is the sum of the value added.  It is also the value of sales of the final good.  

# Flow of Expenditure #

Must be precise as to the type of expenditure.  There are 2 types of expenditure;

1.	Consumption - Expenditures on final goods and services.  Made to meet an immediate need.  Known as consumption
	*	Households - Consumption expenditure on nondurables
		*	domestic
		*	import
	*	Government
		*	domestic
		*	imports
	* 	Foreigners
		*	Exports

2.	Investment - expenditure made on durable goods and services.
	*	Households
		* 	domestic
		* 	imports
	* 	Firms
		* 	Plant and equipment
		*	Inventory of unsold stock
		*	domestic
		*	imports
	*	Government
		*	domestic
		*	imports

## Assumptions ##

Assumptions made in models are not intended to reflect reality. They are intended to aid in 
working with the model.

1.	Firms are the only sector that engages in investment
2.	Households are the only sector that purchases imports

# Flow of Income #

## Firms ##

Firms pay out a proportion of sales as wages, interest, rent, dividends and tax.
The rest is retained earnings + allowance for depreciation.  This is known as business saving.

## Households ##

Receives wages interest rent dividends.  A proportion of household income is used for consumption,
the rest is household savings and to pay taxes.

## Government ##

Recieves tax from firms and households.  Spends via government expenditure.  Government savings = Taxes - Expenditure
If government savings > 0, then there is a budget surplus.  If < 0 then budget deficit.

# National Income Accounting #

Keeping track of economic flow in an economy.  

The value of production over a period can be domestic or sold as exports

## Expenditure Form ##

*	$Y$ is the GDP of the economy
*	$C^{d}$ is the household consumption
*	$G$ is the government expenditure
*	$I$ is the firm investment
*	$X$	is the exports to other economies


$$Y = C^{d} + G + I + X$$

## Income Form ##

*	$S^{b}$ is business saving
*	$M$ is the imports purchased by households
*	$S^{h}$ is the household saving
*	$T$ is the tax payments

$$Y = S^{b} + C^{d} + M + S^{h} + T = C + M + S + T$$


## Result ## 

As all forms of GDP are equivalent, the equations can be rearranged

$$C^{d} + G + I + X = C^{d} + M + S + T$$
$$I = ( M - X ) + ( T - G ) + S$$

This relates the total investment to the difference between imports and exports
and the budget surplus/deficit. 

Define National Saving, $NS$:

$$NS = S + ( T - G )$$

investment becomes

$$I = ( M - X ) + NS$$ 

This relates the import surplus/deficit and the amount of national saving to the investment.
Interesting to note that when there is a trade deficit, then investment is higher than national savings.
This correlates well with data.
