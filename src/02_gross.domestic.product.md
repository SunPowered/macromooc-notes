Gross Domestic Product
======================

An important metric economists use to quantify the size of an economy.  Many aspects of the macro
economy can be described using GDP

# Definition #

	Measures the flow of economic activity in a geographic region (usually a country) 
	over a particular period of time

Flow: A quantity which is changing, transient. Ex: income earned each week. 
	
Stock: a variable defined at a particular point in time. Ex: savings in a bank account

*	Flows build up stock.

# What is Economic Activity? #

Not a simple question, there are 3 distinct way to think about economic activity.

1.	Production		The flow of goods and services produced in and economy over a time period
2.	Expenditure		The flow of spending undertaken in the economy over a given time period
3.	Income			The flow of income earned in an economy over a time period


Amazingly, all 3 forms turn out to be identical.  Measuring economic activity from any of the 3 
forms results in an identical result.

# Flow of Production #

Taking a simple 2 stage production.  2 firms.  Firm 1 produces an intermediate good.  

The factors of production for Firm 1 is labour and capital.

	Labour: 	The workers producing the good
	Capital:	All money needed to keep production running

Firm 2 has its own factors of production; labour, capital, and intermediate good 1.
Firm 2 produces a final good.

If all flows were measured at all stages, there will be a double counting problem with
any intermediate goods. The price of the final good already reflects the cost of the 
intermediate good.  

Ex: Production of loaf of bread

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Stage of 				Value of	   Value of 		  Value Added
 Production				 Sales 		Int Goods ($)		  at the Stage  
--------------       ------------  ---------------     -----------------

      wheat				1.80			0					1.80
	  flour				3.00			1.80				1.20
	  dough				4.00			3.00				1.00
	 bread				4.40			4.00				0.40
														________
												Total		4.40				
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GDP is the sum of the value added.  It is also the value of sales of the final good.  

# Flow of Expenditure #

Must be precise as to the type of expenditure.  There are 2 types of expenditure;

1.	Consumption - Expenditures on final goods and services.  Made to meet an immediate need.  Known as consumption
	*	Households - Consumption expenditure on nondurables
		*	domestic
		*	import
	*	Government
		*	domestic
		*	imports
	* 	Foreigners
		*	Exports

2.	Investment - expenditure made on durable goods and services.
	*	Households
		* 	domestic
		* 	imports
	* 	Firms
		* 	Plant and equipment
		*	Inventory of unsold stock
		*	domestic
		*	imports
	*	Government
		*	domestic
		*	imports

## Assumptions ##

Assumptions made in models are not intended to reflect reality. They are intended to aid in 
working with the model.

1.	Firms are the only sector that engages in investment
2.	Households are the only sector that purchases imports

# Flow of Income #

## Firms ##

Firms pay out a proportion of sales as wages, interest, rent, dividends and tax.
The rest is retained earnings + allowance for depreciation.  This is known as business saving.

## Households ##

Receives wages interest rent dividends.  A proportion of household income is used for consumption,
the rest is household savings and to pay taxes.

## Government ##

Recieves tax from firms and households.  Spends via government expenditure.  Government savings = Taxes - Expenditure
If government savings > 0, then there is a budget surplus.  If < 0 then budget deficit.

# National Income Accounting #

Keeping track of economic flow in an economy.  

The value of production over a period can be domestic or sold as exports

## Expenditure Form ##

*	$Y$ is the GDP of the economy
*	$C^{d}$ is the household consumption
*	$G$ is the government expenditure
*	$I$ is the firm investment
*	$X$	is the exports to other economies


$$Y = C^{d} + G + I + X$$

## Income Form ##

*	$S^{b}$ is business saving
*	$M$ is the imports purchased by households
*	$S^{h}$ is the household saving
*	$T$ is the tax payments

$$Y = S^{b} + C^{d} + M + S^{h} + T = C + M + S + T$$


## Result ## 

As all forms of GDP are equivalent, the equations can be rearranged

$$C^{d} + G + I + X = C^{d} + M + S + T$$
$$I = ( M - X ) + ( T - G ) + S$$

This relates the total investment to the difference between imports and exports
and the budget surplus/deficit. 

Define National Saving, $NS$:

$$NS = S + ( T - G )$$

investment becomes

$$I = ( M - X ) + NS$$ 

This relates the import surplus/deficit and the amount of national saving to the investment.
Interesting to note that when there is a trade deficit, then investment is higher than national savings.
This correlates well with data. 

## Refinements ##

There are some refinements to the concept of GDP which need to be discussed.
First refinement has to do with measurement issue.  This is an important issue in economics.

Example. Assume there are only 2 commodities: cheese and wine. Taking the expenditure GDP

--------------------------------------------------------
Commodity   Variable     2009    2010    2011    2012
---------   ----------  ------  ------  ------  ------
Cheese          q        100     105     108     112
Cheese          p        15      16      18      20
(kilos)       (val)      1500    1680    1944    2240
Wine            q        25      30      38      50
Wine            p        22      20      16      12
(L)           (val)      550     600     608     600
Total GDP       []       2050    2280    2552    2840
--------------------------------------------------------

In this way, the total GDP is called the *nominal GDP*.  This is the sum of the current price times the current
quantity. We are using the current prices to weight the commodities each year.  This price based weighting can also be thought
of as the _social value_ of the good, if the economy is in a market economy.  Resources that are valued highly in a society,
receive a high price, and thus are weighted heavier the calculation of GDP.  This is a core belief in market economies.

### National GDP - A Potential Problem ###

In many cases, in time, the quantity sold of a good goes up and the price goes down.  This trends the nominal GDP
in an unpredictable way.  If the prices are falling faster than the increase in quantity,
then the nom. GDP decreases in time.  If the nom. GDP is falling in time, one cannot infer that it is because of the quantity
increasing or the price decreasing.  Thus, it is useful to use a different concept for GDP, the *Real GDP*.

1.  Declare a base period, usually a year
2.  Value the quantity of goods in relation to the fixed base price.
3.  Future quantities are multiplied by this base price to get a new measure of GDP.

Thus, prices are fixed at this beginning period, and the time dependant quantity are tracked.  

One problem with real GDP.  When we use this base period prices, and we use the prices to value the goods and services
those periods, we are freezing those weights at the base price.  This assumes a fixed social value for the good in time.
This, in particular, does not happen.  Solution to this is what is called a *chain volume index*.  This moves the
base price forward each year.  Thus the real GDP is in reference to last years prices. 

### Unsold Inventory ###

There is a dependance between production and sales.  This does not always happen, there is often unsold goods,
stored as inventory.  This is not as big as problem as one may think.  We can look at the unsold inventories
as a firm investment, to meet an increase in demand in the future.

 Change in inventories is the difference between production and expenditure, this gets added to a firms 
 investment, $I$.

 Now, the relation still holds:

 $$P = E + I$$

## National Income Accounting Identitiy ##

That is, production, expenditure, and income are all equal measures of the GDP.

There are distinct sectors in an economy.

1.  Household
    *   $C^{d} + M$
2.  Firms
    *   I: plant,equipment, inventory investment
3.  Government
    *   G: gov. expenditure
4.  Foreign Sector
    *   X: exports

The financial crisis in 2009 was characterized by a sharp drop in GDP growth.

## The economics of happiness ##

There is a large amount of research being done on the economics of people's  happiness.
There is data supporting the evidence that there is little to no correlation in a nations
GDP and the overall happiness of the citizens.  In some cases, such as East Germany just
after the fall of the wall, there was a correlation between real income and overall well i
being as polled from citizens.
