macromooc-notes.git

My notes from the Coursera MOOC [Macroeconomics](https://class.coursera.org/macroeconomics-001) course

The notes are written using Pandoc Markdown format.  pandoc is required if custom additions are made

To build the notes simply run the command `make pdf` from the project folder.
