Macroeconomics - Week 1
========================

What is Economics
-----------------

Macroecononmics is the study the economics of the aggregrate, 
including monetary & fiscal policy, national output, exchange 
rates, rates of employment and inflation, etc.  These are Issues
 of first order importance, having real economic effects on
people and governments.  Understanding the modern world requires 
an understanding of macroeconomics.

Modern economics goes back to "General Theory of Employment, Interest
and Money" written by John Maynard Keynes in 1936.  This was during the 
Great Depression and saught to provide a new toolset to understand and
analyze the macro economy.


Economics is the science and art of decision making.  In general, the 
needs and wants of a society are *infinite*, yet the resources required
to fulfill these wants and needs are *finite*.  This requires a certain
allocation of resources to best meet society's needs.  Economists study
how these choices are made and the effects of these choices, as well as
whether these choices will require public policy in order to improve the
outcomes.


The Market Mechanism
---------------------

societies have used different mechanisms to allocate their resources.

Command economies (Russia) are where the government planning agencies
made decisions as to where scare resources will be put. Market economies 
allow for a decentralized approach, one where the price system is used
for resource allocation decision making. Consumers and producers try
to optimize their interests, by reacting to the demand and supply produced
by the other, reaching an *equilibrium*.  This is called the *magic of markets*.  This is a highly efficient way of dealing with the allocation 
of scare resources.  

Micro vs Macro
---------------

Most economists see themselves as working in one of the two disciplines,
though the precise definition of each are a little fuzzy.  

Microeconomic analysis emphasizes indiual units of the markets and the
decisions each player makes in response to the market.  

Example micro questions:

	*	With a limited budget, how should members of an indivual household
		organize spending across goods and serbvices to make best use
		of limited resources?
	*	Given market conditions, how does a firm choose how much to produce?
	*	Will prices coordinate household spending and firms production 
		in a way that best allocates societys' limited resources across 
		competing uses?

Macroeconomics shifts the focus to the larger aggregate.  

Example Macro questions:

	*	What dfactors determine how much output a nation produces?
	*	Why fdo recessions occur?
	*	Why do different economies have diferent rates of infaltion?
	*	What roles do montary and fiscal policy play in managing the 
		economy?

Fundamental Welfare Theorems
-----------------------------

There are two fundamental welfare theorems. These place the study of
 macroeconomics in context.

The first fundamental theorem states that under ideal conditions, decentralized decision making
conducted through the mean of the market will led to an optimal allocation
 of resources. Optimal outcome is a situation where there exists no
possible reallocation of resources which will make any one person better 
off without harming at least one other person.  This outcome is often known
as Pareto optimality.   

The second states that there exists a market determined outcome that 
will support any Pareto efficient allocation.

These are important intellectual foundations in the economists view
that undermine the view that market based allocations produce highly
desirable outcomes.  

A great deal of ME deals with market based economies that do not allocate
resources at an optimal level, where the theorems break down.  There
is not complete concensus amongst scholars.  There are
many additional models which seek to attribute these departures.  
some analysis attempts to view  "new-classical economics" or "real business
cycle theory".  

Keynes saw much of macroeconomic outcomes being a result of market 
failure.  The traditional theory was only a special case of the actual
world. The key is careful management of the economy, recognizing there
are limits of what goverments can achieve. 

Macroeconomic Themes

Indicators and Performance
############################
	
What indicators of performance are there? 

1.	Gross Domestic Product - a measure of goods and services produced 
in an economy over a specified time period

Looking at GDP data, there is a long term trend upward.  Much exciting
research has been recently done in this area known as "growth economics".
There is also occasional interruptions in the long run growth, known
as recessions.  These interruptions are addressed in business cycle theory 
and by Keynesian theory.

2.	Rate of inflation - a measure of how much the economy is changing

Rate of inflation - a measure of how much the economy is changing.. 

There is a correlation between an economies GDP and its rate of inflation

3.	Rate of unemployment - increases rapidly during recessions.  Human
cost to the business cycle.  Avoiding recessions, is something
governments can do to avoid the large scale human loss during 
economic recessions, as the human cost to unemployment can be huge.


Models
#######-

Models provide a key way to provide testable hypotheses which can
be applied toreal world data to give us an insight as to the validity of 
a model.  models can simplify abstract concepts and allow
us to 

Public Policy
##############

A central tenant of economics is that markets under ideal conditions
allocate resources efficiently.  Where the markets dont 
allocat efficiently, there is a place for policy to 
adjust the market such as an optimal allocation is
achieved.

Central banks are responsible for the monetaryt policy of
and economy.  

Types of Policy:

*	Monetary Policy: The setting or influencing of financial variables by a nations central bank to manage aggregate soending the short to medium term

*	Fiscal Policy:  The setting of government budgetary variables - expenditure, taxations and public debt

The aims of macroeconomic policy:

*	Rising living standards
*	Avoiding extremes of macroeconomic performance
*	Maintaining the real value of currency
*	Ensuring sustainiable levels of public and private debt
*	Balancing current expenditure against the need to provide resources for the future
*	Providing employment for all individuals seeking work
